        "body": "Thanks so much for looking into this. I just wanted to point out a few requirements we have for this in the core libraries area, for your future work in this area.\n\nWe currently (in Foundation) have three places where we need this:\n- `_NSCFConstantString` class, which we need to know at link time so we can fix up references to constant strings. We currently alias the mangled name in our linker options to make this work.\n- A function call to `_CFSwiftGetBase` class, which happens during __CFInitialize and returns the class we need to use as the base classes for CF types:\n\n```\ninternal func __CFSwiftGetBaseClass() -> AnyObject.Type {\n    return __NSCFType.self\n}\n```\n\nWe currently work around not having a cdecl like this:\n\n```\n#ifndef __CFSwiftGetBaseClass\n#if TARGET_OS_LINUX\n#define __CFSwiftGetBaseClass _TF10Foundation21__CFSwiftGetBaseClassFT_PMPs9AnyObject_\n#elif TARGET_OS_MAC\n#define __CFSwiftGetBaseClass _TF15SwiftFoundation21__CFSwiftGetBaseClassFT_PMPs9AnyObject_\n#endif\n#endif\nextern uintptr_t __CFSwiftGetBaseClass();\n\nuintptr_t NSCFType = __CFSwiftGetBaseClass();\n```\n- Another callout from __CFInitialize to `internal func __CFInitializeSwift() { /* ... */ }`.\n\nAs you can imagine I'd much rather avoid hard coding mangling into our source code...\n\nObviously we'll need to lift the requirement of ObjC interop for us to use this as well.\n",

Here's a series of patches that simplifies the way SILGen emits captures so that they're only passed as boxes, along with follow-up changes to capture promotion, SILCombine, and DI to preserve their existing behavior. Until now, we also claimed that capture addresses were passed @inout, which is semantically incorrect—mutable captures are allowed to be mutated simultaneously from the closure and the original context in well-typed, well-synchronized ways. I introduced a new parameter convention @inout_aliasable to represent these semantics for @noescape mutable captures. I'd like some review of the various pieces before mashing into master:\n> \n> @lattner https://github.com/lattner, I changed SILGen to emit mark_function_escape instructions on variable addresses before they're captured; that way, DI still works on captured variables without having to do concurrent analysis of the box and address value uses. I also adjusted the diagnostics to use the more specific \"captured by a closure\" diagnostic when this happens, instead of the generic \"used before initialized\" diagnostic. Is there a better approach you'd prefer?\n> \n> The DI and related SILGen changes look great to me.  Thanks for doing this, it is an really nice cleanup too.  One bad thing is that it invalidates some slides from our SIL talk :-)\n\n-Chris\n",
