But this function is not implemented correctly.\r\n\r\nThis function is the key to how it works:\r\nhttps://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/afcc2df23aa855220f0d532b404ec393d927520c/okhttp/src/jvmMain/kotlin/okhttp3/ConnectionSpec.kt#L94-L104\r\n\r\n`apply()` function uses `specToApply.tlsVersions != null` to check if an arbitrary version is supported.\r\nThis is how `tlsVersions` is defined:\r\nhttps://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/afcc2df23aa855220f0d532b404ec393d927520c/okhttp/src/jvmMain/kotlin/okhttp3/ConnectionSpec.kt#L74-L77\r\n\r\nIn this function, it converts TLS version string to `TlsVersion`. But an arbitrary input string cannot be converted to `TlsVersion`. It actually throws an exception. The same happens with `cipherSuites`.\r\n\r\nAnd in `toStirng()`, it also uses `tlsVersions` and `cipherSuites`. This makes a `ConnectionSpec` with arbitrary input strings cannot be printed. If you create an exception described with `ConnectionSpec`, it fails again. It makes to know what happened.\r\n\r\nI also add two string compatible getters for `tlsVersions` and `cipherSuites` to Java to help debug `ConnectionSpec`.",

        "body": "This is a feature request similar to https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/1361 and https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/404\r\n\r\nBecause of the complexities mentioned by @swankjesse in this [comment](https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/1361#issuecomment-72937939) we were trying to find a solution that could be built on top of OkHttp with our specific parameters. One solution we thought we found was to override some of the internals of OkHttp, but we were limited due to the fact that these classes are final or have internal/private constructors. One such solution is described below.\r\n\r\nThe **TL;DR** feature request is to support more customizability in the queuing structure. **Option 1:** make Dispatcher an interface that we can implement and make the current `Dispatcher` a `Default Dispatcher`. **Option 2:** make `OkHttpClient` constructor that takes a `Builder` would be made public and `RealCall` could be made an `open` class with a public constructor.\r\n\r\nWe are trying to add a priority queue to our OkHttp requests as we have 3 different types of network requests that should be executed in priority order even with the consideration that that may starve lower priority requests. All of these calls go to the same host so the max requests per host limit is in effect. Additionally, we don't want to increase max requests per host to the max requests value so we don't overload our servers. We have two possible suggestions for how this could be done.\r\n\r\n**Option 1:** Make `Dispatcher` an interface so that we can build our own dispatcher according to our business rules and can control when requests are executed. All of the current `internal` and public functions would be made public and would be part of the interface with `enqueue` being the key function to implement. This would make `enqueue` public which may be less than ideal since developers usually shouldn't be enqueuing themselves directly, but would allow for more customization in dispatch logic.\r\n\r\n*Option 2:** suggested by @swankjesse was to create our own `Call.Factory`. `OkHttpClient` is an `open` class which implements `Call.Factory` so we could subclass it and override `newCall` to return a new type of `Call` that extends `RealCall` and implements it's own `enqueue` to add it's call to the priority queue. We would then have then have to have an `EventListener` that keeps track of the number of active calls per host and total calls since that is not public from the `Dispatcher` by listening for `start` to increment and `cancelled`, `callEnd` or `callFailed` to pop off a value and enqueue it to the `Dispatcher`.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this solution is that while `OkHttpClient` is `open`, it's constructor is `internal`. It does have a public constructor but that uses a default `Builder` which means we can't override the parameters like adding network interceptors which then is a problem. Also `RealCall` is a final class so we can't simply extend it and we would have to copy-paste most of it's logic.",

        "body": "I tried to configure okhttp (v `4.10.0`) to make a GET request to an url through an https proxy that use a self-signed certificate. \r\nI saw these issues: https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/6561 and https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/3787 that are quite similar exept that they do not address the case where you want to disable the certificate verification during the SSL handshake with the https proxy (because in my case, the proxy is using a self-signed certificate, that may change quite frequently. So requiering to have it downloaded in a client keystore is not a practical option).\r\n\r\nHere is the code that I currently have (which is basically the same as the one from @lpuglia in https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/6561 with just a TrustManager that will accept all server's certificates added)  :\r\n\r\n```\r\nString desturl = \"https://api64.ipify.org/?format=json\"; //\"https://myip.com\" //\"http://neverssl.com\" //\"http://silverfinebeautifulsecret.neverssl.com/online/\"\r\n\r\nOkHttpClient.Builder clientb = new OkHttpClient.Builder().proxy(new java.net.Proxy(java.net.Proxy.Type.HTTP, new InetSocketAddress(\"shoutouttomyex.icu\", 443))) ;\r\n\r\n// Create a trust manager that does not validate certificate chains\r\nfinal TrustManager[] trustAllCerts = new TrustManager[] { new X509TrustManager() {\r\n     @Override public void checkClientTrusted(java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] chain, String authType) throws CertificateException { System.out.println(\"checkClientTrusted\"); return;}\r\n     @Override public void checkServerTrusted(java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] chain, String authType) throws CertificateException { System.out.println(\"checkServerTrusted\"); return;}\r\n     @Override public java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() { System.out.println(\"getAcceptedIssuers\");  return new java.security.cert.X509Certificate[]{}; }\r\n} };\r\n\t\t  \r\nfinal SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance(\"SSL\");\r\nsslContext.init(null, trustAllCerts, new java.security.SecureRandom());\r\nfinal SSLSocketFactory sslSocketFactory = sslContext.getSocketFactory();\r\n\t\t  \t\t  \r\nclientb.socketFactory(new DelegatingSocketFactory(sslSocketFactory));\r\nclientb.hostnameVerifier(new HostnameVerifier() {\r\n     @Override public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) { System.out.println(\"Verify \"+hostname); return true; }\r\n});\r\n\r\nokhttp3.Request.Builder rbuilder = new Request.Builder().url(desturl).get();\r\n \r\nResponse response = clientb.build().newCall(rbuilder.build()).execute();\r\nSystem.out.println(\"Answer: \"+response.body().string());\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Note: I don't need any Authenticator as my https proxy is an opened proxy to which you can connect without any username and password)\r\n\r\nthe problem is that when requesting an https url with this code, I systematically get an answer with a 404 error. Here is the output that I have:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncheckServerTrusted\r\ngetAcceptedIssuers\r\njava.io.IOException: Unexpected response code for CONNECT: 404\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.connection.RealConnection.createTunnel(RealConnection.kt:483)\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.connection.RealConnection.connectTunnel(RealConnection.kt:262)\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.connection.RealConnection.connect(RealConnection.kt:201)\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.connection.ExchangeFinder.findConnection(ExchangeFinder.kt:226)\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.connection.ExchangeFinder.findHealthyConnection(ExchangeFinder.kt:106)\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.connection.ExchangeFinder.find(ExchangeFinder.kt:74)\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.connection.RealCall.initExchange$okhttp(RealCall.kt:255)\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.connection.ConnectInterceptor.intercept(ConnectInterceptor.kt:32)\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.http.RealInterceptorChain.proceed(RealInterceptorChain.kt:109)\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.cache.CacheInterceptor.intercept(CacheInterceptor.kt:95)\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.http.RealInterceptorChain.proceed(RealInterceptorChain.kt:109)\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.http.BridgeInterceptor.intercept(BridgeInterceptor.kt:83)\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.http.RealInterceptorChain.proceed(RealInterceptorChain.kt:109)\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.http.RetryAndFollowUpInterceptor.intercept(RetryAndFollowUpInterceptor.kt:76)\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.http.RealInterceptorChain.proceed(RealInterceptorChain.kt:109)\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.connection.RealCall.getResponseWithInterceptorChain$okhttp(RealCall.kt:201)\r\n\tat okhttp3@4.10.0/okhttp3.internal.connection.RealCall.execute(RealCall.kt:154)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand if I request an http url (like `http://silverfinebeautifulsecret.neverssl.com/online/`) I don't have any error but I get an empty answer (which is also a bug as I should receive the page body). Here is the output with an http destination url:\r\n```\r\ncheckServerTrusted\r\ngetAcceptedIssuers\r\nAnswer: \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same chain of request (requesting an url through my https proxy with proxy's certificate verification disabled) is working just fine with curl.\r\nHere is the output that I get with this curl command : `curl -x https://shoutouttomyex.icu:443 https://api64.ipify.org/?format=json --proxy-insecure -v` :\r\n\r\n```\r\n*   Trying 65.49.2.58:443...\r\n* Connected to shoutouttomyex.icu (65.49.2.58) port 443 (#0)\r\n* ALPN: offers http/1.1\r\n* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Server hello (2):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Encrypted Extensions (8):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Certificate (11):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, CERT verify (15):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Finished (20):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS change cipher, Change cipher spec (1):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, Finished (20):\r\n* SSL connection using TLSv1.3 / TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\n* ALPN: server accepted http/1.1\r\n* Proxy certificate:\r\n*  subject: CN=shoutouttomyex.icu\r\n*  start date: Mar 21 03:28:06 2023 GMT\r\n*  expire date: Jun 19 03:28:05 2023 GMT\r\n*  issuer: OU=generated by Avast Antivirus for SSL/TLS scanning; O=Avast Web/Mail Shield; CN=Avast Web/Mail Shield Root\r\n*  SSL certificate verify result: unable to get local issuer certificate (20), continuing anyway.\r\n* allocate connect buffer\r\n* Establish HTTP proxy tunnel to api64.ipify.org:443\r\n> CONNECT api64.ipify.org:443 HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: api64.ipify.org:443\r\n> User-Agent: curl/8.0.1\r\n> Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive\r\n>\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Newsession Ticket (4):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Newsession Ticket (4):\r\n< HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n< X-RS: rs71\r\n<\r\n* CONNECT phase completed\r\n* CONNECT tunnel established, response 200\r\n* ALPN: offers h2,http/1.1\r\n* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):\r\n*  CAfile: C:\\Development\\utils\\curl-8.0.1_4-win64-mingw\\bin\\curl-ca-bundle.crt\r\n*  CApath: none\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Server hello (2):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS change cipher, Change cipher spec (1):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Server hello (2):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Encrypted Extensions (8):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Certificate (11):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, CERT verify (15):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Finished (20):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, Finished (20):\r\n* SSL connection using TLSv1.3 / TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\n* ALPN: server accepted h2\r\n* Server certificate:\r\n*  subject: CN=*.ipify.org\r\n*  start date: Feb  7 00:00:00 2023 GMT\r\n*  expire date: Feb 18 23:59:59 2024 GMT\r\n*  subjectAltName: host \"api64.ipify.org\" matched cert's \"*.ipify.org\"\r\n*  issuer: C=GB; ST=Greater Manchester; L=Salford; O=Sectigo Limited; CN=Sectigo RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA\r\n*  SSL certificate verify ok.\r\n* using HTTP/2\r\n* h2h3 [:method: GET]\r\n* h2h3 [:path: /?format=json]\r\n* h2h3 [:scheme: https]\r\n* h2h3 [:authority: api64.ipify.org]\r\n* h2h3 [user-agent: curl/8.0.1]\r\n* h2h3 [accept: */*]\r\n* Using Stream ID: 1 (easy handle 0x2bbe2549f10)\r\n> GET /?format=json HTTP/2\r\n> Host: api64.ipify.org\r\n> user-agent: curl/8.0.1\r\n> accept: */*\r\n>\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Newsession Ticket (4):\r\n< HTTP/2 200\r\n< content-type: application/json\r\n< date: Mon, 27 Mar 2023 20:52:58 GMT\r\n< vary: Origin\r\n< content-length: 21\r\n<\r\n{\"ip\":\"64.62.219.63\"}* Connection #0 to host shoutouttomyex.icu left intact\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

New Relic is trying to add support for okhttp-sse and found out one part of the code for RealCall causes cast exception.\r\n> The New Relic Android agent provides performance monitoring instrumentation, we use ASM to perform byte-code injection to collect data from performance issues to tiny errors within the code.\r\n\r\n> When integrate both New Relic android agent and okhttp-sse library, we found a crash in `RealEventSource` class file at this line--> `call = client.newCall(request) as RealCall`\r\n\r\n**Why are we getting the crash and potential solutions:**\r\n1. RealCall cannot be implemented as it's a final class - Solution 1: Can we adjust RealCall class to be public?\r\n2. Casting newCall as RealCall causes the crash `call = client.newCall(request) as RealCall` - Solution 2: Can we adjust this part of the casting to use a public class?\r\n\r\nAbove are what I have found out so far, any insights are appreciated. Thank you. \r\n\r\n",

My second assumption, which I found to be true through testing, is that these functions cannot actually use the `internal` modifier. \r\n\r\nSo, the solution to me would be to have some prefix that others are unlikely to type, such as `okToImmutableList`. I'll admit though that when actually calling this function within these OkHttp libraries does look a bit ugly. \r\n\r\nI am open to suggestions on other prefixes, or other ways to solve this!

Is the file I linked to above just a placeholder, and an updated version is grabbed some other way, or is it really just quite outdated?\r\n2. Is there some mechanism I should be doing outside of `okhttp` to provide a newer public suffix list for `okhttp` to consume?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

        "body": "When using an `OkHttpClient` instance with a `Proxy` / `ProxySelector`, if a network change happens so that the proxy address resolves to a different IP address, the client is not able to reach out to the request URL anymore... In such a case, we typically see a `SocketTimeoutException`:\r\n\r\nAnd note that:\r\n\r\n* If you do not reuse your instance of `OkhttpClient` but create a new one, this issue does not happen. \r\n* If you do NOT use the proxy, and change the scenario so that it is the request host DNS resolution that changes. The problem does not happen neither. \r\n\r\nThis tells me that this might be a bug very specific to the use of `ProxySelector` in OkHttp. Unless consumers are expected to handle this in which case I would be interested to know how exactly ? (Interceptors, ...)\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n### How to Reproduce (Scenario)\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this, you need to have a proxy setup and you need to be able to change the address that the proxy hostname resolves to.\r\n\r\n* Spin up a Proxy and a DNS to serve it with a specific hostname\r\n* Create an `OkHttpClient` instance with a `ProxySelector`\r\n* Execute a request with the `OkHttpClient` against a URL reachable through the proxy\r\n* Make a change to the Proxy DNS resolution: typically the proxy host remain the same but the IP of the proxy - that the DNS will resolves to - changes\r\n* Execute the same request with the same instance of the `OkHttpClient`\r\n    --> it now fails to reach out to the proxy. Yo ucan try again and again and it always fails...\r\n\r\nI am using kubernetes to do this. My proxy runs in a pod and has a service in front of it. So both the service and the POD have a specific IP. What I do to provoke that network change is to remove the service and the pods and recreate them. The hostname remains - the service DNS `squid-proxy.squid.svc.cluster.local` - but the IP it resolves to is now pointing to the new pod that is different.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Project\r\n\r\nI dod not find a way to create a simple test form this. But I created a small Java project https://github.com/Dohbedoh/test-clients that do the same request in a loop at 90s interval. The 90s interval is enough to provoke that network change. Also using an interceptor to get more logging. See https://github.com/Dohbedoh/test-clients/blob/f72cd1a3fdbd2b930b1297ee2d4a82f4237d7f26/src/main/java/com/dohbedoh/Main.java.\r\n\r\nWhat I do is\r\n\r\n* I run against `https://api.github.com/rate_limit/`:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava \\\r\n  -Dcom.dohbedoh.proxyHost=\"squid-proxy.squid.svc.cluster.local\" \\\r\n  -Dcom.dohbedoh.proxyPort=3128 \\\r\n  -cp test-clients-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.dohbedoh.Main \"https://api.github.com/rate_limit\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n* I wait for the first request to succeed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFeb 17, 2023 2:25:19 AM com.dohbedoh.Main$LoggingInterceptor intercept\r\nINFO: [APPLICATION] Sending request http://api.github.com/rate_limit on null\r\n\r\nFeb 17, 2023 2:25:19 AM com.dohbedoh.Main$LoggingInterceptor intercept\r\nINFO: [NETWORK] Sending request http://api.github.com/rate_limit on Connection{api.github.com:80, proxy=HTTP @ squid-proxy.squid.svc.cluster.local/10.30.130.211:3128 hostAddress=/10.30.130.211:3128 cipherSuite=none protocol=http/1.1}\r\nHost: api.github.com\r\nConnection: Keep-Alive\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\r\nUser-Agent: okhttp/4.10.0\r\n\r\nFeb 17, 2023 2:25:19 AM com.dohbedoh.Main$LoggingInterceptor intercept\r\nINFO: [NETWORK] Received response for http://api.github.com/rate_limit in 74.0ms\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\nLocation: https://api.github.com/rate_limit\r\nDate: Fri, 17 Feb 2023 02:25:19 GMT\r\nX-Cache: MISS from squid-proxy-bdb677474-scv2j\r\nX-Cache-Lookup: MISS from squid-proxy-bdb677474-scv2j:3128\r\nVia: 1.1 squid-proxy-bdb677474-scv2j (squid/5.6)\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\n\r\nFeb 17, 2023 2:25:20 AM com.dohbedoh.Main$LoggingInterceptor intercept\r\nINFO: [NETWORK] Sending request https://api.github.com/rate_limit on Connection{api.github.com:443, proxy=HTTP @ squid-proxy.squid.svc.cluster.local/10.30.130.211:3128 hostAddress=/10.30.130.211:3128 cipherSuite=TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 protocol=h2}\r\nHost: api.github.com\r\nConnection: Keep-Alive\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\r\nUser-Agent: okhttp/4.10.0\r\n\r\nFeb 17, 2023 2:25:20 AM com.dohbedoh.Main$LoggingInterceptor intercept\r\nINFO: [NETWORK] Received response for https://api.github.com/rate_limit in 74.8ms\r\naccess-control-allow-origin: *\r\naccess-control-expose-headers: ETag, Link, Location, Retry-After, X-GitHub-OTP, X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset, X-OAuth-Scopes, X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes, X-Poll-Interval, X-GitHub-Media-Type, Deprecation, Sunset\r\ncache-control: no-cache\r\ncontent-security-policy: default-src 'none'\r\ncontent-type: application/json;

Context:\r\n\r\nThe documentation for `ConnectionPool` mentions this:\r\n> HTTP requests that share the same Address may share a Connection.\r\n\r\nThis means if we have two services whose DNS records point to some overlapping set of IPs (e.g. because they share a load-balancer), we _might_ reuse a connection first used for service A when accessing service B later.\r\nIf we're using HTTP2 this can even happen over with TLS (HTTP1 would force a different connection to allow for SNI; HTTP2 can multiplex).\r\n\r\nThis seems like an unlikely scenario at first, but we ran into it while rolling out IPv6 support for some of our services:\r\n- our clients connect to a series of services in order\r\n- all services live behind a common HTTP2-capable load-balancer\r\n- one of them (S) was \"dualstacked\" before the others by getting an `AAAA` DNS record\r\n- service S actually needed the information \"can this client speak IPv6?\" (keeping the \"why\" out-of-scope; suffice to say it's the reason why it was prioritized over the other services)\r\n- service S almost never saw connections via v6 (even for clients we _know_ had working v6 connectivity) :boom: \r\n\r\nLooking back it's clear we were reusing an existing v4 connection to some previous service to talk to a dualstacked service, which \"shadowed\" v6 support in almost all cases (except when we happened to run into connection-pool limits between calls).\r\n\r\nI'm reluctanct to call this  _bug_ because in most cases an existing connection is what you want. However, I still see two possible improvements:\r\n1. expand the docs to include a mention to this edge case. Something like:\r\n   > \"HTTP requests that share the same Address may share a Connection. Conversely, if one request resolves to address A, a subsequent request resolving to addresses A and B may never see any connections to address B.\"\r\n2. optionally extend the ip-to-connection mapping to consider all resolved IPs (becoming maybe \"hash-of-ips\"-to-connection?). This would incur some minor overhead at the advantage of ensuring connection reuse is tried _only_ when it's sane.\r\n\r\nwdyt?",

However, due to the dependency changes (from `com.squareup.okio:okio` `v2.8.0` to `com.squareup.okio:okio-jvm` `v3.0.0`) the issue persists, because now the concerned library `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7` `v1.5.31` is imported by `okio-jvm`, which previously wasn't.  \r\n  \r\n`com.squareup.okio:okio-jvm` `v3.3.0` imports a more recent version of `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7`, so it doesn't get flagged. However, there is no `v4` version of okhttp that imports `okio-jvm` `v3.3.0`.  \r\n   \r\nCode analysis tools like SonarQube with OWASP Dependency-Check recognize this vulnerable library and mark okhttp as vulnerable too. I know this is a false positive, but having multiple projects come up with the same issue is not ideal when updating a single dependency can solve it - plus, it's generally never bad to switch to newer versions when possible, if they don't have breaking changes. Given that okhttp `v5` is in alpha development, it would be nice to have a non-flagged `v4` version available to use in the meanwhile.  \r\n  \r\nThank you!",
