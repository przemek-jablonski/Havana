Personally, I was glad to see it go away when we moved to GitHub Actions and I greatly prefer the explicit version. In other projects I'm editing the README and CHANGELOG when I release to indicate the next version so I'm not sure whether there's a ton of value in automating only one location.\r\n\r\nIf you want to go down the automating route I would like to see a workflow that's manually dispatched where the version is in the input. It would automatically update the README, migrate the CHANGELOG entries from an \"Unreleased\" section to a versioned section, and do the `gradle.properties` update/tag/update dance.",

Since the version of JavaPoet we depend on is also 1.13.0, the GAV coordinates of JavaPoet and the :interop:javapoet modules are exactly the same -\r\ncom.squareup:javapoet:1.13.0, which Gradle can't disambiguate.\r\n\r\nRenaming the modules should help avoid this problem. A cleaner solution would've been to change the group name to a unique value, e.g. com.squareup.kotlinpoet, but this will have to wait until 2.0.\r\n\r\nFixes #1507 ",

In order to provide an easy way to filter container logs the `tc` prefix has been added to display all container logs or `tc.<image-name:tag>` for a specific one. Check the [logging docs](https://www.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/logging_config/).\n-   There is a new `WaitStrategy`, `ShellStrategy`. It can also be used by calling `Wait.forSuccessfulCommand(<command>)`\n\n##### New integration\n\n[Jib](https://togithub.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) has been integrated to Testcontainers in order to take advantage of the nice API it provides to create containers\n\n```java\nGenericContainer<?> busybox = new GenericContainer<>(\n                new JibImage(\n                    \"busybox:1.35\",\n                    jibContainerBuilder -> {\n                        return jibContainerBuilder.setEntrypoint(\"echo\", \"Hello World\");\n                    }\n                )\n            )\n                .withStartupCheckStrategy(new OneShotStartupCheckStrategy().withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(3)))\n```\n\n##### New modules 🆕\n\n##### CrateDB module\n\nIn order to use `CrateDBContainer` , declare the dependency in your pom.xml/build.gradle\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.testcontainers</groupId>\n    <artifactId>cratedb</artifactId>\n    <version>1.18.0</version>\n    <scope>test</scope>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n```gradle\ntestImplementation \"org.testcontainers:cratedb:1.18.0\"\n```\n\nChoose a [crate](https://hub.docker.com/\\_/crate) image version and use it as declared below with your postgres driver\n\n```java\nCrateDBContainer cratedb = new CrateDBContainer(\"crate:5.2.5\");\n```\n\n##### Solace Module\n\nIn order to use `SolaceContainer` , declare the dependency in your pom.xml/build.gradle\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.testcontainers</groupId>\n    <artifactId>solace</artifactId>\n    <version>1.18.0</version>\n    <scope>test</scope>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n```gradle\ntestImplementation \"org.testcontainers:solace:1.18.0\"\n```\n\nNow, you can use a Solace PubSub running in a container and connecting via AMQP by doing the following:\n\n```java\nSolaceContainer solace = new SolaceContainer(\"solace/solace-pubsub-standard:10.2\");\nsolace.start();\nSession session = createSession(\n                solaceContainer.getUsername(),\n                solaceContainer.getPassword(),\n                solaceContainer.getOrigin(Service.AMQP)\n            );\n```\n\nMore information about `SolaceContainer` can be found in the [documentation](https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/solace/).\n\n##### Container modules\n\n##### CockroachDB\n\nStarting with `cockroachdb/cockroach:22.1.0`, there is support for setting the username, password and database name via environment variables. Now, the Testcontainers module provides convenient setters:\n\n```java\nCockroachContainer cockroach = new CockroachContainer(\"cockroachdb/cockroach:22.1.0\")\n    .withUsername(\"test_user\")\n    .withPassword(\"test_password\")\n    .withDatabaseName(\"test_database\");\n```\n\n##### GCloud module\n\nGoogle has released a new image which supports ARM and therefore  `BigtableEmulatorContainer`, `DatastoreEmulatorContainer`, `FirestoreEmulatorContainer`, `PubSubEmulatorContainer` now support it as well.\n\nSo, if previously you were doing something like\n\n```java\nDockerImageName.parse(\"gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/google-cloud-cli:380.0.0-emulators\")\n    .asCompatibleSubstituteFor(\"gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk\");\n```\n\nNow, you can simply do\n\n```java\nDockerImageName.parse(\"gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/google-cloud-cli:380.0.0-emulators\");\n```\n\n##### JUnit Jupiter Module\n\n`@Testcontainers` offers a new attribute `parallel`, which start those containers classes annotated by `@Container`\n\n```java\n@&#8203;Testcontainers(parallel = true)\nclass ParallelTest {\n\n\t@&#8203;Container\nprivate static final PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgres = new PostgreSQLContainer<>(\"postgres:15-alpine\")\n    .withCopyFileToContainer(MountableFile.forClasspathResource(\"db.sql\"), \"/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/\")\n    .withNetwork(network)\n    .withNetworkAliases(\"postgres\");\n\n@&#8203;Container\nprivate static final ToxiproxyContainer toxiproxy = new ToxiproxyContainer(\"ghcr.io/shopify/toxiproxy:2.5.0\")\n    .withNetwork(network);\n\n}\n```\n\n##### Kafka Module\n\nSelf-managed or Kraft mode (a.k.a Zookeeperless) support has been added\n\n```java\nKafkaContainer kafka = new KafkaContainer(DockerImageName.parse(\"confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1\")).withKraft()\n```\n\n##### LocalStack Module\n\n`SERVICES` environment variable became optional in version 0.13.0 and instead LocalStack will initialize a service once the first request is served. So, nowadays `LocalStackContainer` can be used just like this:\n\n```java\nLocalStackContainer localstack = new LocalStackContainer(\"localstack/localstack:2.0.0\");\n```\n\nAlso, LocalStack module supports version 2.0. It is highly recommended to use the latest version of LocalStack images.\nLast but not least, dependency on AWS SDK V1 was dropped.

In order to provide an easy way to filter container logs the `tc` prefix has been added to display all container logs or `tc.<image-name:tag>` for a specific one. Check the [logging docs](https://www.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/logging_config/).\n-   There is a new `WaitStrategy`, `ShellStrategy`. It can also be used by calling `Wait.forSuccessfulCommand(<command>)`\n\n##### New integration\n\n[Jib](https://togithub.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) has been integrated to Testcontainers in order to take advantage of the nice API it provides to create containers\n\n```java\nGenericContainer<?> busybox = new GenericContainer<>(\n                new JibImage(\n                    \"busybox:1.35\",\n                    jibContainerBuilder -> {\n                        return jibContainerBuilder.setEntrypoint(\"echo\", \"Hello World\");\n                    }\n                )\n            )\n                .withStartupCheckStrategy(new OneShotStartupCheckStrategy().withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(3)))\n```\n\n##### New modules 🆕\n\n##### CrateDB module\n\nIn order to use `CrateDBContainer` , declare the dependency in your pom.xml/build.gradle\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.testcontainers</groupId>\n    <artifactId>cratedb</artifactId>\n    <version>1.18.0</version>\n    <scope>test</scope>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n```gradle\ntestImplementation \"org.testcontainers:cratedb:1.18.0\"\n```\n\nChoose a [crate](https://hub.docker.com/\\_/crate) image version and use it as declared below with your postgres driver\n\n```java\nCrateDBContainer cratedb = new CrateDBContainer(\"crate:5.2.5\");\n```\n\n##### Solace Module\n\nIn order to use `SolaceContainer` , declare the dependency in your pom.xml/build.gradle\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.testcontainers</groupId>\n    <artifactId>solace</artifactId>\n    <version>1.18.0</version>\n    <scope>test</scope>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n```gradle\ntestImplementation \"org.testcontainers:solace:1.18.0\"\n```\n\nNow, you can use a Solace PubSub running in a container and connecting via AMQP by doing the following:\n\n```java\nSolaceContainer solace = new SolaceContainer(\"solace/solace-pubsub-standard:10.2\");\nsolace.start();\nSession session = createSession(\n                solaceContainer.getUsername(),\n                solaceContainer.getPassword(),\n                solaceContainer.getOrigin(Service.AMQP)\n            );\n```\n\nMore information about `SolaceContainer` can be found in the [documentation](https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/solace/).\n\n##### Container modules\n\n##### CockroachDB\n\nStarting with `cockroachdb/cockroach:22.1.0`, there is support for setting the username, password and database name via environment variables. Now, the Testcontainers module provides convenient setters:\n\n```java\nCockroachContainer cockroach = new CockroachContainer(\"cockroachdb/cockroach:22.1.0\")\n    .withUsername(\"test_user\")\n    .withPassword(\"test_password\")\n    .withDatabaseName(\"test_database\");\n```\n\n##### GCloud module\n\nGoogle has released a new image which supports ARM and therefore  `BigtableEmulatorContainer`, `DatastoreEmulatorContainer`, `FirestoreEmulatorContainer`, `PubSubEmulatorContainer` now support it as well.\n\nSo, if previously you were doing something like\n\n```java\nDockerImageName.parse(\"gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/google-cloud-cli:380.0.0-emulators\")\n    .asCompatibleSubstituteFor(\"gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk\");\n```\n\nNow, you can simply do\n\n```java\nDockerImageName.parse(\"gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/google-cloud-cli:380.0.0-emulators\");\n```\n\n##### JUnit Jupiter Module\n\n`@Testcontainers` offers a new attribute `parallel`, which start those containers classes annotated by `@Container`\n\n```java\n@&#8203;Testcontainers(parallel = true)\nclass ParallelTest {\n\n\t@&#8203;Container\nprivate static final PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgres = new PostgreSQLContainer<>(\"postgres:15-alpine\")\n    .withCopyFileToContainer(MountableFile.forClasspathResource(\"db.sql\"), \"/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/\")\n    .withNetwork(network)\n    .withNetworkAliases(\"postgres\");\n\n@&#8203;Container\nprivate static final ToxiproxyContainer toxiproxy = new ToxiproxyContainer(\"ghcr.io/shopify/toxiproxy:2.5.0\")\n    .withNetwork(network);\n\n}\n```\n\n##### Kafka Module\n\nSelf-managed or Kraft mode (a.k.a Zookeeperless) support has been added\n\n```java\nKafkaContainer kafka = new KafkaContainer(DockerImageName.parse(\"confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1\")).withKraft()\n```\n\n##### LocalStack Module\n\n`SERVICES` environment variable became optional in version 0.13.0 and instead LocalStack will initialize a service once the first request is served. So, nowadays `LocalStackContainer` can be used just like this:\n\n```java\nLocalStackContainer localstack = new LocalStackContainer(\"localstack/localstack:2.0.0\");\n```\n\nAlso, LocalStack module supports version 2.0. It is highly recommended to use the latest version of LocalStack images.\nLast but not least, dependency on AWS SDK V1 was dropped.

It's currently only enabled for NSView and UIView but that might be all we need. I haven't tested yet, but I think this should let us remove the cklib workaround for extending `layoutSubviews` in Kotlin code. Hopefully it also works for properties like `intrinsicContentSize`.",

For example, consider the following RPC interface:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Serializable // or new annotation - TBD\r\ninterface RemoveService {\r\n    fun doSomething(request: SomethingRequest): SomethingResponse\r\n    // may have other methods as well\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Serializable class SomethingRequest(...) \r\n@Serializable class SomethingResponse(...) \r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is needed, as a part of the Kotlin serialization library is a way to automatically construct a proxy object for the `RemoteService` (or any other \"serializable\" interface) that converts calls into the serialized form that can be later deserialized and converted back into invocations on an instance of such interface.

It's for calls across VMs that live in the same process, but it's effectively the same thing since it's a different heap. We leverage kotlinx.serialization for the parameters as well as encoding the calling convention.\n\nProblems we've faced:\n- Serializing failures where the exception type might not be present on the other side.\n- Using suspend calls and tracking cancellation. We have a general-purpose mechanism for sending references which allows us to \"serialize\" the continuation and other references that otherwise are impossible like `Flow`.\n\nProbably more that I can't remember.",
