        "body": "## What's Changed\r\n\r\n* Fixed: SwiftUI can write to bindings at inopportune times, like if a text field in a sheet is focussed, it will write to the binding _after_ the sheet has been dismissed. When using `IfLetStore`, this can lead to noisy runtime warnings emitted by TCA, where optional state driving the sheet is now `nil`, and thus the binding cannot write to state at this time. As a workaround, `IfLetStore` will now ignore actions sent through bindings when state is `nil` (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1879).\r\n* Fixed: A bug in Swift 5.7 and earlier can cause the runtime metadata mechanism used by swift-case-paths to crash in release mode when an `Any` existential exists in the type data. Because `BindingAction` holds onto an `Any` under the hood, it could be responsible for the occasional crash in release mode when present in certain type layouts. We've worked around this bug to prevent crashes in release mode (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1881).\r\n* Infrastructure: Fix docs link (thanks @Jager-yoo, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1874); add note to reducer protocol dependency docs (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1873); updated CoC to the latest Contributor Covenant.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/compare/0.50.0...0.50.1",

If you notice any regressions in your app's reducer builders, please [let us know](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yml).\r\n* Changed: The Composable Architecture has been updated to depend on [SwiftUI Navigation 0.6.0](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swiftui-navigation/releases/0.6.0) (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1865).\r\n\r\n    > **Warning**: This upgrade contains breaking changes that mostly do not affect the Composable Architecture, with the exception of its UIKit alert helper tools, which will now require you to handle a `nil` alert action for dismissal/cancel buttons with no action attached.\r\n\r\n* Fixed: #1802 introduced a slight regression in view store binding animation behavior, so it was reverted back to the original behavior (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1845).\r\n* Fixed: `Effect` is now hard deprecated as planned (thanks @kalupas226, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1822).\r\n* Fixed: The Composable Architecture now explicitly depends on Ordered Collections, rather than implicitly via its transitive dependency on Identified Collections (thanks @kalupas226, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1828).\r\n* Fixed: `TestStore.receive` methods that take predicates and case paths no longer require `Action` equatability (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1856).\r\n* Infrastructure: Removed and updated a few deprecated, flakey tests (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1816).\r\n* Infrastructure: Added UI test to catch SwiftUI regressions (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1815; thanks @tgrapperon in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1819).\r\n* Infrastructure: Doc fixes (thanks @brennobemoura, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1843).\r\n* Infrastructure: Document testing gotchas (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1854).\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @jshier made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1834\r\n* @brennobemoura made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1843\r\n* @drucelweisse made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1824\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/compare/0.49.2...0.50.0",

In apps built in the Composable Architecture, which provides flexible tools for deriving custom bindings, this could lead to accessing state that no longer exists, which at worst could try to evaluate an element of an array at an invalidated index, crashing the application. While this bug was fixed in 0.48.0, it introduced another regression and was reverted in 0.48.1. We have a new workaround (thanks @iampatbrown, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1802), that appears to be more reliable and work in both cases. If you encounter any regressions in `ViewStore.binding` behavior in your applications, [let us know](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yml)!\r\n* Fixed: `Dependencies` has been force-bumped to 0.1.2 to work around a regression in how effects inherit dependencies (thanks @tgrapperon, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1813).\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/compare/0.49.1...0.49.2",

It can introduce re-entrancy bugs. Instead, we have introduced a synchronous version (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1792).\r\n* Fixed: `@Dependency(\\.openURL)` is now supported in App extensions (thanks @tgrapperon, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1714).\r\n* Fixed: `ButtonRole` and `Button` deprecation warnings have been silenced (thanks @kgrigsby59, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1715).\r\n* Fixed: A longstanding bug in SwiftUI can cause bindings to be evaluated in views that are no longer rendered. In apps built in the Composable Architecture, which provides flexible tools for deriving custom bindings, this could lead to accessing state that no longer exists, which at worst could try to evaluate an element of an array at an invalidated index, crashing the application. This bug has now been worked around to avoid such crashes. (Thanks @barabashd, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1784; https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1785).\r\n* Fixed: The predicated-based version of `TestStore.receive` now properly evaluates the given predicate (thanks @pyrtsa, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1780).\r\n* Infrastructure: Fix typos, etc., in documentation, README, and tests (thanks @ZevEisenberg, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1701; @tgrapperon, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1702; @yimajo, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1725; @yuanhang, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1762; @kalupas226, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1764; @dy-kim, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1773; @Iikeli, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1776; https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1787; @jeffersonsetiawan, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1793).\r\n* Infrastructure: Fix todo deletion in Todos sample app when the list is filtered (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1696).\r\n* Infrastructure: Bump SwiftUINavigation and update examples (thanks @iampatbrown, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1760).\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n\r\n* @ZevEisenberg made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1701\r\n* @yuanhang made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1762\r\n* @dy-kim made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1773\r\n* @Iikeli made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1776\r\n* @barabashd made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1784\r\n* @pyrtsa made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1780\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/compare/0.47.2...0.48.0",

These dependency values are used when processing `initialState`, which means state that relies on `@Dependency` (`\\.uuid`, for example) will use these dependencies.\r\n* Changed: `TestStore` was recently, briefly made an `open` class, but we are marking it `final` again (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1655). We are open to making it `open` again, but would like to know if there are use cases, first.\r\n* Fixed: `@Dependency(\\.openURL)`'s `callAsFunction`s overloads are no longer ambiguous in certain cases (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1621).\r\n* Fixed: Printing is now disabled when running debugged reducers from Xcode previews (thanks @tgrapperon, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1625).\r\n* Fixed: Documentation typos (thanks @PierreCapo, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1609; @tgrapperon, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1608; @ts, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1612; @Jager-yoo, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1638; @hmhv, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1659).\r\n* Infrastructure: Case Studies modernization (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1623); CI cleanup (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1632); documentation additions (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1642); dependencies test (thanks @crayment, https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1644).\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n\r\n* @PierreCapo made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1609\r\n* @crayment made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1644\r\n* @hmhv made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1659\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/compare/0.45.0...0.46.0",

        "body": "## What's Changed\r\n\r\n* Requirement Change: Swift 5.6 is now required as of the release of the `ReducerProtocol` (#1491); we'd love to support Swift 5.5 still, but need help from the community: #1494.\r\n* Deprecation/Rename: The `Reducer` type alias is now hard-deprecated to be renamed to `AnyReducer` to help call out reducers that should be migrated (#1478). The `ReducerProtocol` will be renamed to `Reducer` in the future and this hard deprecation makes room for it.\r\n* Deprecation/Rename: The `Effect` type has been renamed to a soft-deprecated `EffectPublisher` type, both generic over `Action` and `Failure`, while a temporary `EffectTask` type alias has been introduced as a replacement that is only generic over `Action` (#1471). This rename is in preparation for breaking changes in a forthcoming 1.0 release, where the `EffectTask` will become `Effect`, and will only be generic over `Action`.\r\n* Change: Some interfaces that previously required escaping closures no longer require them (#1493; thanks @tgrapperon , #1513).\r\n* Bug fix: `ReducerProtocol.transformDependency` is now properly fused with upstream calls to `ReducerProtocol.dependency` and `ReducerProtocol.transformDependency` (#1495).\r\n* Bug fix: `ViewStore.yield(while:)` is now performed on the main actor (#1517).\r\n* Infrastructure: Documentation fixes (thanks @luoxiu, #1470; @qmoya, #1473; @Jager-yoo, #1475, #1490; @gohanlon, #1482; @GREENOVER, #1483; @yimajo, #1484, #1485; @roeybiran, #1479; @tgrapperon, #1509; @ts, #1504; @sillygoose, #1507; #1523); demo fixes (thanks @tgrapperon, #1492; @Jager-yoo, #1503); new benchmark for view stores (#1518).\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n\r\n* @luoxiu made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1470\r\n* @qmoya made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1473\r\n* @gohanlon made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1482\r\n* @GREENOVER made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1483\r\n* @roeybiran made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1479\r\n* @ts made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1504\r\n* @sillygoose made their first contribution in https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/pull/1507\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/compare/0.42.0...0.43.0",

See our [blog post](https://www.pointfree.co/blog/posts/80-improving-composable-architecture-performance) for information about those changes.\r\n\r\n- Added: `WithViewStore(_:observe:…)`, a new initializer that makes state observation explicit. We hope these initializers will help users avoid performance pitfalls and identify areas of their application where performance can be improved. The existing initializers have been soft-deprecated and will surface warnings in a future release.\r\n- Performance: `Effect` performance has been improved, especially with regard to merging effects (a common operation that occurs when reducers are combined), and async effects (which previously often incurred overhead from Combine).\r\n- Performance: `Store.scope` performance has been improved for nested scopes, which no longer incur a penalty for each layer of scoping (thanks @iampatbrown).\r\n- Performance: `WithViewStore` now uses a state object under the hood, which should tie the lifecycle of a view store to a view (thanks @tgrapperon).\r\n- Performance: `ForEachStore` performance has been improved for state updates in which element state has changed but no elements were added, removed, or moved (thanks @tgrapperon).\r\n- Fix: `Effect.run`'s `Send` closure is now explicitly `@MainActor`.\r\n- Fix: Long-living effects no longer accumulate `Task` values in memory for each action sent back into the store, saving memory over time.\r\n- Fix: macOS 11 compilation with the Xcode 14 release candidate.\r\n- Fix: Actions that re-enter the store at the end of processing are now processed immediately.\r\n- Infrastructure: README fixes (thanks @Jager-yoo).\r\n- Infrastructure: Added benchmarks for effects, store scoping.\r\n- Infrastructure: Fixed Todos demo's incrementing UUID helper (thanks @pitt500).\r\n- Infrastructure: Fixed Voice Memos AV settings (thanks @entaku0818).",
