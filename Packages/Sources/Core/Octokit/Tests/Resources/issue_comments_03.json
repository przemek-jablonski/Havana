I think for most browser-based use cases, adding gaps ala MicroTask scheduling probably isn't completely necessary because the event stream sources themselves will be async, but there's definitely a need for that type of scheduler.\n",

        "body": "This was discussed quite a bit. The goal, long term, is to produce files for ES6 modules, AMD, CJS, as well as ES5 globals... Since ES6 is a subset of TypeScript, it should \"just work\" to import ES6 modules.\n\nAs a matter of personal taste, I'm not a huge fan of having to maintain interfaces, but I'm not the only one working on this project (even though I have the lion's share of commits right now). It's a team effort, especially in terms of design. If the folks responsible for helping me design this implementation decide it would be best to convert to TypeScript, I'm 100% on board.\n\nFor now, though, I'm going to close this issue because I know what the result of the last discussion was.\n\n(Closing obviously doesn't end the discussion)\n",

        "body": "Observables are referentially transparent, so they can be optionally async. If you encapsulate all state within the Observable operators, your code will work the same whether it runs synchronously or asynchronously.\n\nPromises (etc.) force asynchrony because they are stateful. This is sometimes called [Releasing Zalgo](http://blog.izs.me/post/59142742143/designing-apis-for-asynchrony), and is a problem people encounter when they write programs that rely on mutable external state.\n\nOne solution is to always force asynchrony (at the cost of performance). The other (and better imo) solution is to write code that doesn't rely on side-effects.\n",
